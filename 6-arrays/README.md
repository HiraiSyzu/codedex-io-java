# ðŸ’¾ 21. Survival Pack


# ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Going On:
Youâ€™re getting ready for a zombie apocalypse (yeah, wild, I know). Youâ€™ve packed some must-have survival items in your bag.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to create and use a string array in Java â€” basically, a container where you can store multiple pieces of data (strings) under one variable name.

ðŸ”§ What You Need to Do:
Create a String array called survivalPack.

Put 5 different items inside it â€” these can be any items you think would help in a survival situation (Water Bottle, First Aid Kit, Flashlight, 
Energy Bars, Knife).

ðŸ“˜ Notes & Tips:
In Java, array indexing starts at 0, not 1.

So:
survivalPack[0] â†’ first item
survivalPack[4] â†’ fifth item
