# ðŸ’¾ 21. Survival Pack


# ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Going On:
Youâ€™re getting ready for a zombie apocalypse (yeah, wild, I know). Youâ€™ve packed some must-have survival items in your bag.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to create and use a string array in Java â€” basically, a container where you can store multiple pieces of data (strings) under one variable name.

**ðŸ”§ What You Need to Do:**
Create a String array called survivalPack.

Put 5 different items inside it â€” these can be any items you think would help in a survival situation (Water Bottle, First Aid Kit, Flashlight, 
Energy Bars, Knife).

**ðŸ“˜ Notes & Tips:**
In Java, array indexing starts at 0, not 1.

So:
survivalPack[0] â†’ first item
survivalPack[4] â†’ fifth item

# ðŸ’¾ 22. Position 0

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Going On:
In this exercise, you'll learn how to access and print specific values from an array. 

Youâ€™ll be working with a **String array** where you have a set of items, and you need to retrieve the **first item** (which is at **position 0**). 

This is a great way to practice working with arrays and understanding how array indexing works in Java!

### ðŸ”§ What You Need to Do:
Create a **String array** that holds several items (Gold Coin, Emerald, Silver Ring, Ruby Necklace, Ancient Map, Diamond Crown, Ruby, Golden Katana, Treasure Map).

Your task is to print out the  items that u want from treasure chest.

### ðŸ“˜ Notes & Tips:
- Remember, in **Java**, **arrays start at index 0**.
- So, to access the **first item** of the array, youâ€™ll use `array[0]`.
