💾 21. Survival Pack
🧠 What’s Going On:
You’re getting ready for a zombie apocalypse (yeah, wild, I know). You’ve packed some must-have survival items in your bag.

In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create and use a string array in Java — basically, a container where you can store multiple pieces of data (strings) under one variable name.

🔧 What You Need to Do:
Create a String array called survivalPack.

Put 5 different items inside it — these can be any items you think would help in a survival situation (food, tools, gear, etc.).

Print out each item using its index.

📘 Notes & Tips:
In Java, array indexing starts at 0, not 1.

So:
survivalPack[0] → first item
survivalPack[4] → fifth item
