This is a simple console-based game I made in Java where you take care of your own virtual pet. You can name your pet and choose actions like feeding, playing, or letting it sleep. Each action affects your pet's hunger, happiness, and energy, and your goal is to keep it alive and happy for as long as you can.

If your pet gets too hungry, too tired, or too sad, the game endsâ€”but donâ€™t worry, you can choose to restart and take better care next time.

Features:

Custom pet name

Action choices using numbers (1 to 3)

Stats update after every action

Natural stat changes over time (like hunger increasing)

Game over and restart system

Input handling with Scanner

Basic use of if conditions and loops

What I Learned:

I made this project to improve my Java skills and understand how a game loop works. I learned a lot about:

How while loops can keep a game running

The importance of using gameRunning = false to stop infinite loops

How equalsIgnoreCase() can handle user input without case sensitivity problems

Why itâ€™s important to close Scanner to avoid resource leaks

And just how small typos or capitalization issues can break a program ðŸ˜…
