# 🐾 Pet Simulator Game (Java Console)

This is a simple pet simulator I made using Java. It runs in the console. You can name your pet, then take care of it by feeding, playing, or letting it sleep. But be careful — if hunger gets too high, or happiness or energy gets too low, it's game over.

## 🎮 Features

- You can give your pet a name
- Pick between 3 actions: Feed, Play, or Sleep
- Pet stats change every turn
- If any stat goes too far, the game ends
- You can choose to continue or stop playing
- Uses only basic stuff like loops and ifs — no OOP or methods yet
- Scanner is closed properly so there’s no resource leak

## 🔧 How the game works

You start with:

- Hunger = 5  
- Happiness = 5  
- Energy = 5  

Each action affects the stats. For example:

- Feeding lowers hunger but drains energy  
- Playing makes your pet happy but tires it out  
- Sleeping gives back energy  

After your action, time passes and hunger goes up, happiness and energy go down. So you gotta balance it.

If hunger hits 10, or happiness or energy drop to 0, the game ends. But you can choose to restart the game if you want.

## 💭 Why I made this

I made this to practice Java, especially loops, conditionals, and using Scanner. I had bugs like infinite loops and stuff, but I figured it out. This helped me understand how code flows and how even small typos can break the whole thing.

## ▶️ How to run

1. Copy the code to a file named `PetSimulatorGame.java`  
2. Open terminal or cmd  
3. Compile it using: `javac PetSimulatorGame.java`  
4. Run it with: `java PetSimulatorGame`  

That’s it. Hope you like it 🐶
